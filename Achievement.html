    <p>My journey through high school was anything but easy, especially with the challenges brought by the COVID-19 pandemic during my Form 4 and Form 5 years. Despite the uncertainties and disruptions, I remained determined and worked hard to achieve my goals. In my SPM, I proudly secured 9As and 1B+, and I was honored with the Best Subject Award for Biology, History, and Tasawwur Islam. It was a tough road, but with perseverance and dedication, I managed to complete my high school journey with flying colors. I am truly grateful for this achievement, and I know I couldn't have done it without the unwavering support of my parents, friends, and teachers. Their encouragement and guidance played a huge role in my success, and for that, I will always be thankful.</p>

    <p>It was an honor to receive an award from the former <strong>Ketua Polis Negara</strong> for achieving excellent results in my SPM. Shaking hands with him was a truly memorable moment, especially knowing that he is also an alumnus of my school. His name is <strong>Tan Sri Dato' Seri Panglima Acryl Sani bin Haji Abdullah Sani</strong>, and I feel privileged to have had the opportunity to meet him in person.</p>

    <p>My first and second semesters in my Software Engineering degree were tough, but I managed to make it to the  <strong>Dean's List</strong> for both semesters. It was an incredible moment to be recognized at the <strong>Majlis Anugerah Prestij Fakulti</strong>, an awards ceremony conducted by my faculty. What made it even more special was celebrating this achievement with my friends. I was even prouder when our Software Engineering course received the Best Course Award for having the highest number of Deanâ€™s List recipients, with my batch leading the way! I feel truly grateful to be surrounded by such intelligent, hardworking, and dedicated people who continue to inspire me.</p>

    <p>Receiving the <strong>Permodalan Nasional Berhad (PNB) Scholarship </strong> has been the biggest achievement of my academic journey. Being awarded a scholarship from such a prestigious investment company is truly an honor. I am incredibly grateful to have successfully passed all **four stages of the interview process**, which was both challenging and rewarding. This scholarship has not only eased my financial burden but also strengthened my determination to study even harder. It serves as a constant reminder to always be grateful and to make the most of this incredible opportunity.</p>
