        <h2>Hi, I'm Hazriq Haykal!</h2>
        <p>I'm a Second-Year Student pursuing a <strong>Bachelor's in Software Engineering</strong> at  
            <strong><span style="color:maroon;">Universiti Putra Malaysia</span></strong>.</p>

        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Currently, I am learning <em>Flutter</em> for app development and exploring <em>natural language processing (NLP)</em> using Python. I enjoy working on <em>challenging projects</em> that push me to expand my knowledge and refine my problem-solving abilities. One of my ongoing projects is a <em>bus tracking system</em> for my university, which allows me to apply both my <em>software engineering</em> and <em>AI skills</em> in a practical setting. I also have an interest in <em>AI-driven applications</em>, such as my plan to develop a <em>recipe recommendation app</em> that suggests meals based on available ingredients while considering dietary preferences and allergies.</p>

        <p>Beyond academics, I have a deep passion for <em>fitness</em> and <em>travel</em>. I enjoy going to the gym regularly, as it helps me stay <em>disciplined</em>, maintain a <em>healthy lifestyle</em>, and improve my <em>physical and mental well-being</em>. Traveling to natural places is another hobby I deeply appreciate—I love exploring <em>scenic landscapes</em>, whether it’s hiking in the mountains or visiting beautiful beaches. These experiences allow me to disconnect from my routine, gain fresh perspectives, and find inspiration for my work. Additionally, I am an <em>avid gamer</em>, particularly enjoying <em>immersive</em> and <em>strategic games</em> that challenge my <em>critical thinking</em> and <em>creativity</em>.</p>

        <p>Throughout my academic journey, I have remained dedicated to <em>excellence</em>. I have consistently been on the <em>Dean’s List</em> every semester of my bachelor's degree and was also a <em>top student</em> during my foundation studies. In high school, I achieved <em>outstanding results</em>, scoring <em>9As in SPM</em>. My success in academics is the result of my strong focus, <em>time management</em>, and ability to balance multiple commitments effectively. I believe in <em>setting clear goals</em>, staying <em>disciplined</em>, and continuously pushing myself to improve.</p>

        <p>Aside from my studies, I have actively participated in various competitions, including <em>hackathons</em> and <em>programming challenges</em>. These experiences have sharpened my <em>coding skills</em>, enhanced my ability to <em>work under pressure</em>, and allowed me to collaborate with <em>talented individuals</em>. I thrive in <em>competitive environments</em> where I can put my skills to the test and push my limits to achieve the best results.</p>

        <p>My ultimate goal is to become a <em>highly skilled software developer</em> and contribute to <em>innovative technological solutions</em>, particularly in <em>AI</em> and <em>mobile applications</em>. I want to create software that makes a <em>meaningful impact</em> on people’s lives, whether through <em>smarter AI-driven systems</em>, <em>efficient mobile applications</em>, or <em>groundbreaking tech solutions</em>. With my <em>passion</em>, <em>dedication</em>, and <em>continuous learning mindset</em>, I am confident in my ability to achieve these aspirations.</p>
