<h1>This is my working experience.</h1>

<p>My first work experience was at <em>Tealive Plus Pavilion</em>, and it was one of the toughest jobs I’ve had. The store was always crowded with customers, making it a fast-paced and high-pressure environment. On top of that, some staff members were not very disciplined in coming to work, which made things even more challenging. However, I gained valuable skills, such as handling the kitchen, memorizing drink-making procedures, and managing the cashier. Despite the difficulties, it was a memorable first job that taught me responsibility, adaptability, and teamwork.</p>

<p>I had the opportunity to work at <em>Zara KLCC</em>, where I received the best payment since I started working. Adapting to a new environment took some time, especially when communicating with staff members who were older than me. However, it turned out to be an incredible experience that helped me improve my communication skills, as I interacted with many foreign customers daily. I also gained valuable knowledge about different clothing materials and fashion retail operations. Overall, it was one of the best experiences I’ve ever had, and I’m grateful for everything I learned during my time there.</p>

<p>During my semester break, I worked at <em>Kelem Gula Apong</em>, a startup business. This experience opened my eyes to the challenges of running a startup, from operations and budgeting to management and handling staff. I also learned hands-on skills, such as making ice cream, adding toppings, and perfecting the use of gula apong. Beyond the technical aspects, this job taught me the dedication and resilience needed to start and sustain a business. It was an eye-opening experience that gave me valuable insights into entrepreneurship and the effort required to make a business thrive.</p>
