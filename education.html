            <p>I attended SJK(C) Pei Hwa Kota for my primary school education, where I studied in Chinese and made many Chinese friends. This experience helped me become fluent in the language and exposed me to a diverse cultural environment. During my time there, I learned valuable lessons about discipline and time management, which have greatly benefited me in my studies and daily life. The teachers and students were always supportive and welcoming, even though I am Malay, making my school experience enjoyable and enriching.</p>

            <p>I attended an all-boys secondary school in Kuala Lumpur, where the environment was energetic and sometimes aggressiveâ€”typical of a school full of boys! For me, it was a great experience as I adapted to a new atmosphere, made many friends, and built strong connections. Despite the lively and competitive nature of the school, I stayed focused on my studies and managed to score 9As in SPM. My time there taught me resilience, teamwork, and the importance of balancing academics with an active social life.</p>

            <p>For my foundation in science, I studied at Pusat Asasi UPM, where I experienced a completely new environment. I met many new friends who were incredibly talented and intelligent, which motivated me to improve myself. Throughout my time there, I learned valuable skills from them, such as effective communication and how to present confidently during presentations. The classes were always enjoyable, filled with funny and supportive people, making the experience both educational and memorable. Although it was a short journey, it was filled with sweet memories that I will always cherish.</p>

            <p>My journey to becoming a software engineer began here at the Faculty of Computer Science, Universiti Putra Malaysia. From the very start, I have been surrounded by supportive coursemates, especially my boys' gang, who always have each other's backs. The lecturers here are kind and always willing to help, making the learning experience even more enjoyable. I have gained so much knowledge and grown both academically and personally. Alhamdulillah, my CGPA is currently good, and I am truly grateful for everything. May Allah bless my journey ahead!</p>
